Open-Source Repository for Rowan County Digital Archives, Technologies, News, History, &amp; More.

## Welcome to the Open-Source Rowan County, NC Repository on Github
*Rowan County, NC Public Digital Warehouse*

#### Introduction

The goal of the project is to make a repository of digital assets specifically tailored to Rowan County's needs. We plan to include everything we can possibly think of digitally that could be used by web developers, students, businesses, and/or the community at large to develop technologies, research projects, localized advertising documents, or neighborhood picnic flyers. Basically a warehous of digital data like templates for webpages, photos of Rowan County, NC, historical data, government information, and other easily accessible information needed to study and work in the Rowan County area digitally.

In addition to being a treasure trove of information about Rowan County, this repository will also house the technologies being developed with the RocoNews.com open-source news and economic development platform. We have lots of ideas for web applications and technologies specifically tailored for Rowan County, NC that can be used by government, non-profit orgranizations, schools, and individuals for a number of technological uses.
